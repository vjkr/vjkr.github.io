## Fitness Retrograde

Wow. I have not been on here in a WHILE. I think it's safe to say that my new years' resolution to start (and maintain) a blog was a massive fail. But hey, its only (the end of) September, so there's still time to salvage things. <i> Right? </i> 

A LOT has happened in the past few months - 2018 has been a pretty good year for me (although pretty stressful at times). For example, I've managed to achieve what is probably my biggest goal (albeit, non-fitness related) and finally managed to secure a training contract!!! It still hasn't properly sunk in that, after all these years of hard work, I am FINALLY going to be a lawyer!

Since getting my TC, several things have happened:

1. <b> I quit my job as a paralegal </b> - despite being convinced that the firm I was working at was the firm I was going to train at, it turns out that another firm was a better fit for me..not only did they think I was good enough the first time they assessed me, but they liked me <i> so </i> much, that they offered for me to start a year early! I've always believed that I'm more than capable of making it as a lawyer, but I can't tell you how amazing it feels for another firm see something in me too, and for me to be one of their top choices, as opposed to a back-up option if one of the other candidates drops out. I knew that they were my type of firm on the first day of my vac scheme, when one of the partners introduced the firm by saying <i> "we have a no wankers policy here". </i>  It was at that point that I knew it was the firm for me.

2. <b> I went back to law school </b> - In order to start my training contract and be allowed to practice as a solicitor, I need to complete the Legal Practice Course (LPC). I've therefore gone back to law school for a year. As someone who has earned a decent-ish salary for a few years, this is an adjustment to say the least. On the plus side, it means I can go to the gym lots in the day when it is quiet. However, being a student also means I'm now absolutely broke....I've managed to get a part-time job at a pub I used to work at during the holidays' whilst at university - the money is awful (i.e. minimum wage) but the people are nice. Hopefully I'll get by (after a few lifestyle adjustments) and be able to juggle working on top of my studies. 

3. <b> Fitness Retrograde </b> - I made SO much progress in terms of my fitness goals from January - April. I lost 11lbs and got down to 23/24% body fat and to a size 8 (UK). I was beginning to become pretty happy with the way I looked. During the early part of the year, I had a crazy amount of motivation to get in shape as I went to Thailand in March and wanted to be shredded by the time I hit the beach. I achieved this by:

    1. Implementing intermittent fasting - I fasted 16 hours and ate for 8 hours every day (i.e. I would fast from 8pm at night and break my fast at 12pm the next day). For me, this was a really effective tool to ensure I didn't go over my calories for the day. For some reason, as soon as I've eaten breakfast (no matter how filling or wholesome it might be) I am CONSTANTLY hungry every couple of the hours for the rest of the day, which makes eating in a calorie deficit SO HARD. So, for me, IF works a treat. 

    2. Increased my workouts - I worked out at least 5 times a week (maybe 6). I lifted weights the majority of the time and incorporated at least 2 HIIT sessions (fasted) per week. Sometimes the IF would mean that I didn't have the energy to lift my heaviest, but I made sure to lift as heavy as I possibly could and really push myself at each session, and focus on nailing my form to make sure I was getting the full benefit of each exercise. 

    3. ditching meat - until recently, I was a vegetarian (well, technically a pescetarian) for ethical reasons. Whilst I was initially worried that this would mean that my carb intake increased dramatically and I would pile on the pounds as a result, surprisingly, the opposite happened. Becoming a vegetarian forced me to eat healthier by incorporating more vegetables into my diet (which I used to avoid), making healthier choices generally (as I was conscious about eating enough protein and not relying too heavily on the carbs and cheese) and by eliminating so many fast foods that often tempted me and played a large role in me falling off track in the past (McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Dirty Burger...you get the picture). 

    4. avoiding alcohol - this year I successfully completed dry January. For me, this was a <i> challenge </i>. But I did it, and lost 7lbs in the process. Aside from the extra calories from the alcohol, the food I'd eat whilst drunk on the way home (<i>hello, cheesy chips and/or pizza</i>) and the junk food I'd eat whilst hungover the next day would undo any progress I'd made during the week. It would also mean I didn't make it to the gym whilst hungover. As soon as I ditched the alcohol, the weight started to drop off. I also experienced a host of other benefits, such as having more energy, not waking up at 4am with horrendous heart palpitations and not experiencing the dreaded beer fear in the morning and wanting to die in a hole from embarrassment at memories from the previous night. 

    5. I tracked my macros and calories - whilst I have a surprising talent for being able to tell you how much Protein, Fats and Carbs are in the majority of foods, tracking really helped me remain accountable and ensured I didn't overeat. It also informed me when I needed to eat MORE (rarely the case, but equally important for muscle gain and progress).

    Fast-forward several months and I'm nearly back to the point where I was in January. <i> whoops. </i> I think it's safe to say that when I found out I got my TC I celebrated A LOT. And when one of my best friends, Clare, got her TC shortly afterwards, I celebrated some more. I basically drank prosecco for a good two months' straight and lived off of pizza and pub food. Before I knew it, I'd gained half a stone. <b> SHIT. </b>

    I did try and get back on track, but as I had no holiday's or events coming up, I strugged to find motivation (my "<i>why?"</i> ). As everyone knows, getting back on track and shifting half a stone is bloody HARD work, especially if you're not techncically overweight and are doing it "just because". It's safe to say that I didn't get very far. I'd last for a few days, and as soon as someone convinced me to go for "a quick drink" (<i> yeah, right. </i>), that was it. 3-4 drinks later, and a good carby meal and that was my progress for the week ruined. And the cycle would start again.

    Fast forward to today. I've now regained my "why?". I miss feeling comfortable in my own skin. I miss being able to wear whatever I want. I miss not worrying if I'm going to be able to <i> comfortably </i> fit into my jeans on any given day. I'm sick of feeling deflated by the fact that it's September and I'm in WORSE shape than I was in March. So, its time to do something about it. 

<i> The Plan? </i>

Implementing the steps I took whilst I was preparing for my holiday in Thailand and updating my blog with my progress each week. I'm hoping to reach the following goals by the end of the year:

Current Weight: 9 Stone 12 (138lbs)\
Current Body Fat: unknown (would estimate between 28 - 29%)

Goal Weight: 9 Stone (126lbs)\
Goal Body Fat: 20%

Wish me luck!\
B xx
