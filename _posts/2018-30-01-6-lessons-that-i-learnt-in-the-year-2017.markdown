## 6 Lessons that I learnt in the year 2017 

2017 was definitely a challenging year for me. It was by no means an easy ride - in fact, at some points, it was pretty bloody awful and felt like one of the worst years of my life I'd ever experienced. Despite this, 2017 wasn't all doom and gloom and, looking back, I'm actually thankful for the obstacles I faced last year as they led me to turn to the gym as a means of escape and, ultimately, discover my passion for health and fitness. 

It was around May 2017 (when I was at my most miserable, heaviest and out-of-shape I had ever been) that I decided stop moaning about my weight, and actually *do* something about it. and I did. Since then, I've lost 13lbs and have gained a considerable amount of strength and muscle. I'm also in the best shape I've been in since starting my first year of university, over 7 years ago (eeek I feel old!!). Although I still have a long way to go until I reach my fitness goals, my body confidence is probably the highest it's *ever* been (which I think is a bloody great achievement in itself).

*So, how did I do this?* 

Through educating myself. For me personally, this involved undertaking my own research (i.e. reading articles, watching workouts on YouTube, listening to what other educated people in the fitness industry had to say) and finding an amazing personal trainer (who I originally thought would just teach me the basics, but I grew to love training with him so much that I still train with him several times a week today). Educating myself also involved *a lot* of trial and error, and took the best part of a year. However, below are the main things I learnt in 2017, which may hopefully help some of you starting-out on your fitness journey:

1. <b> There are no quick fixes </b> - you are not going to lose weight overnight, it's just not going to happen. No fad diet out there will work in the long term. Changing your body will take time. Irritating, I know, but you just need to accept it. The quicker you do, the more time and money you'll save yourself in the long run (you're welcome). 

2. <b> Pick an exercise you love </b> - the only way to make exercise a habit you will actually stick to is to *enjoy* it. Exercise should be fun (and not a punishment). If you don't know what you like, try as many different types of exercise as you can and you'll soon figure it out! The choices are endless (weightlifting, dancing, boxing, swimming, Zumba, walking, cycling, running, yoga, pilates - try as many things as you can and you're bound to like one of them). 

3. <b> Consistency is everything </b> - just as it takes time, it also takes consistent effort to see a change in your body. I'd always been a member of the gym, but would go infrequently (going 4 times in a week, and then not going again for a month or so). This got me absolutely nowhere (don't do that). 

4. <b> It is almost impossible to lose weight consistently whilst drinking lots of alcohol (REALLY?! Yup, really) </b> - well, for me it is, anyway. I did drink regularly during May - December 2017, and I did lose weight. However, it definitely hindered my progress (for example, it took me 7 months to lose 7 lbs whilst regularly drinking, and I was working out 4-5 days a week. Tomorrow, I will have completed 1 full month without drinking...and I've lost 6 lbs...I've basically managed to achieve the same result I achieved in 7 months in 4 weeks). Coincidence? I think not.

5. <b> Different things work for different people </b> - there is no one single way to lose weight or get in shape. For me, I've discovered that lifting heavy weights and HIIT cardio in terms of exercise, and intermittent fasting in terms of diet work really well - figuring this out will ultimately involve some trial and error and take time. But guess what? *That is ok*. 

6. <b> Some people will judge you and be dicks about your progress </b> - although I've had so many nice compliments from people who have seen my transformation, there are still people who will judge you *("you're obsessed with the gym", "you're boring now you don't drink", "you spend HOW much on personal training?!, "you're going to end up bulky/too skinny/with no boobs and/or bum").*  Quite frankly, those people aren't worth your time. Remember this is YOUR life - your true friends will support you, and those people giving you shit or trying to make you doubt yourself? well, *BYE FELICIA.*
